# ExhibitAccess
Omeka plugin to assign limited user access to Exhibits

Based on the more complex [Editorial plugin](https://github.com/omeka/plugin-Editorial), which adds conversation to Exhibit development. This plugin strips out what's needed for that, and focuses just on the access control.

# Installation

Usual Omeka plugin installation. Put the code in `plugins/` and go to the admin side plugins page, hit install.

# Usage

Go to the `Exhibit Access` tab on the admin side, and for each exhibit, select how gets special access. Admins and Supers still have all their access. Other users get to edit Exhibits as they are selected by Exhibit owner.
